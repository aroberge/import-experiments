# λ-encoding

This is an experiment to create a custom encoding where the Greek letter
λ would be interpreted/converted as the Python lambda keyword.
The purpose is to learn what is needed to create a custom encoding
and use it.


My original motivation for looking at codecs was from
[a comment left on one of my blog posts](https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2015/10/from-experimental-import-somethingnew.html?showComment=1444820092247#c5491554166542490140)
some four years ago.
At some point, I stumbled upon Dropbox's [Pyxl package](https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl).
I used GvRs' Python 3 version, [Pyxl 3](https://github.com/gvanrossum/pyxl3),
as a starting guide for this much simpler project.
